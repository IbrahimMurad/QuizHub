## Overview

QuizHub is a web application designed as a platform for both learners and educators to create virtual classrooms whether public or private, enroll in existing ones, and create and take tests. Users can also manage submissions and control access to classrooms.

The project is divided into two parts:
- **Frontend:** Responsible for the user interface.
- **Backend:** Manages business logic, API endpoints, authentication, and database interaction.

## Installation

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js**: v14.x or higher [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB**: v4.4 or higher [Download here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaryEhb/QuizHub.git
   cd QuizHub
   ```

2. **Setup the Backend first**:
   - Follow the instructions in the [Backend README](./backend/README.md) to set up the server.
   - This will guide you through installing dependencies, setting up environment variables, and starting the backend server.

3. **Then Setup the Frontend**:
   - Navigate to the [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md) and follow the setup steps.
   - After setting up the backend, you can start the frontend server.

## Architecture

QuizHub follows a client-server architecture:

- The **client** sends requests to the **web server**, which serves static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) and communicates with the **application server**.
- The **application server** handles business logic and connects to the **MongoDB database**, where user, classroom, test, and submission data is stored.

Here's a high-level view of the architecture:

## Technologies Used

In terms of technologies, I used a combination of tools to bring *QuizHub* to life. Below is a breakdown of the tools and technologies used for different aspects of the project:

### Design

- **Figma**: For designing user interfaces before development began. Figma allowed me to prototype and create a visual structure, ensuring the user experience is intuitive and well-planned before moving into the development phase.

### Frontend Development

- **React** [![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-17.x-blue?logo=react)](https://reactjs.org/):  
  React was used for its component-based architecture, which makes the development process modular and scalable. It also enables dynamic handling of data, ensuring efficient rendering and updates across the UI. Reactâ€™s state management made it easier to manage interactions between different components.
  
- **SASS** [![SASS](https://img.shields.io/badge/SASS-CSS%20Preprocessor-pink?logo=sass)](https://sass-lang.com/):  
  A CSS preprocessor that provides features like variables, nesting, and mixins to keep stylesheets organized and maintainable. SASS was used to manage styling, enabling reusable styles across different components and improving the overall maintainability of the codebase.

- **Axios** [![Axios](https://img.shields.io/badge/Axios-HTTP%20Client-blue?logo=axios)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios):  
  A promise-based HTTP client used to handle API requests from the frontend to the backend. Axios was chosen for its simplicity in managing asynchronous requests and responses, ensuring smooth data retrieval and form submissions.

### Backend Development

- **Node.js** [![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-14.x-green?logo=node.js)](https://nodejs.org/):  
  Node.js was used as the backend runtime environment. Its non-blocking I/O model allows for efficient handling of multiple requests, and the ability to write both frontend and backend code in JavaScript ensures consistency across the entire application stack.

- **Express.js** [![Express](https://img.shields.io/badge/Express-4.x-yellow?logo=express)](https://expressjs.com/):  
  A minimal and flexible Node.js framework, Express was used to manage routing, middleware, and HTTP request handling. This framework simplified the development of the backend API, helping build robust and secure endpoints.

- **Passport.js** [![Passport](https://img.shields.io/badge/Passport.js-Authentication-blue?logo=passport)](https://www.passportjs.org/):  
  Used to manage user authentication. Passport provided a flexible authentication middleware, enabling me to securely manage user logins, registrations, and session persistence.

### Database

- **MongoDB** [![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-4.4-green?logo=mongodb)](https://www.mongodb.com/):  
  A NoSQL database used to store the data for users, classrooms, tests, and submissions. MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility in handling unstructured data and scalability, making it suitable for a growing application like *QuizHub*.

- **Mongoose** [![Mongoose](https://img.shields.io/badge/Mongoose-ODM-red?logo=mongoose)](https://mongoosejs.com/):  
  An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, Mongoose simplifies data modeling and enforces schema validation, making database interactions more manageable. It helped ensure data consistency and enabled the use of MongoDB in a structured, object-oriented way.

### Testing & Development Tools

- **Postman** ![Postman Logo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Postman-API%20Testing-orange?logo=postman):  
  Postman was used to test all API endpoints. This tool helped ensure that the backend API was functioning correctly by simulating client requests and checking the responses for accuracy and performance.

- **VS Code** ![VS Code Logo](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS%20Code-Editor-blue?logo=visual-studio-code):  
  Visual Studio Code was my editor of choice due to its powerful extensions, integrated Git support, and debugging tools. Its user-friendly interface and extensive plugin ecosystem helped streamline the development process.
