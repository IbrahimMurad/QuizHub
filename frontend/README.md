# QuizHub

Welcome to QuizHub, a web application for creating and managing quizzes. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

### Running the App

To start the development server, use:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app. The page will reload automatically when you make changes. Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### Testing

To run tests, use:

```bash
npm test
```

This will launch the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information on running tests, check the [Create React App testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### Building for Production

To build the app for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will bundle the app and optimize it for performance. The build files will be placed in the `build` folder. Your app is now ready for deployment!

For more information on deployment, see the [Create React App deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### Ejecting

If you need more control over the build configuration, you can eject by running:

```bash
npm run eject
```

**Note**: This is a one-way operation. Ejecting will expose the build configuration files and dependencies, giving you full control but also requiring you to manage them manually.
